# Telegrambot_patients

This is my student project, the task of which is to learn how to set interaction between client app (in my case, it is telegram bot), django server and database.

## Design

Raising the server and setting up the API you can see [here](https://github.com/Dannikk/DjangoREST_Api/tree/develop), this repository contains the implementation of the bot telegrams written in python using a third-party library - `aiogram`

## Using

To use my bot write it: @patients_db_bot
